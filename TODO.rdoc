* Support data diffing for arrays (including data struct).

* Allow for showing diffed sections of a diff only.
  Do it by sorted paths? Example:
    - "/path/foo": "value1"
    + "/path/bar": "value1"

* Should these Path case be handled as looking for a blank node or any node?
    "/path/foo="
    "/path/=foo"
